# EJGB Policy DSL v0.1

**Purpose**
A minimal, readable policy language to express
*who can approve what, and when execution must stop*.

This DSL is designed for:
- Enterprise security teams
- Compliance / audit alignment
- Human-oversight enforcement

**Principle**
> Policies describe *permission to execute*, not automation.
