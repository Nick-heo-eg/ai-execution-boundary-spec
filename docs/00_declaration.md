# EJGB v1.0 Declaration

AI agents now act on operating systems.
When text becomes action, mistakes become damage.

EJGB establishes a non-negotiable boundary:
**Judgment precedes execution.**

Principles:
1. Separation of proposal, judgment, execution
2. Explicit human responsibility for irreversible actions
3. Default HOLD for high-risk intents
4. Auditability over convenience

This is not a framework.
This is a boundary.
